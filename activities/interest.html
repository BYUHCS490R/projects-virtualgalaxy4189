        <h2>What is Arcane?</h2>
        <p>Arcane is an animated steampunk action-adventure tv series. It is a mix of sceince-fiction and steampunk. The story is about the emerging conflict between two sides of a utopian city. One side are the rich, powerful and privileged side, Piltover and the other side is the oppressed underworld/slums of the city, Zaun.</p>
        <p>The tv series Arcane is based on the multiplayer online battle arena game, League of Legends. It is based on the playable characters in the game and depicts some of the background and history of some of the characters.</p>

        <h2>Why do I like Arcane?</h2>
        <p>I love this tv series because the animation is amazing (it was animated by the same animators that animated "Spider-man: Into the spider-verse") and I love the plot of the show. I also love the characters portrayed in the show.</p>
